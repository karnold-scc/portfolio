    <div class="about">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>With over six years of programming experience, I am a junior developer who is 
            looking to turn her long-time passion into a career. After discovering programming in 
            ninth grade, I have always known that this industry was the place for me. I have 
            participated in numerous events designed to teach young girls that coding and 
            computing are not just for men, and I dream of furthering those initiatives and proving
            to young girls that technology is for everyone. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I was first introduced to programming as a serious interest in ninth grade. 
            Since then, I have been absolutely hooked. Outside of programming, I can usually be found
            either curled up with a book, or sweating it out at the gym. 
            My dream career would be in an organization like HackerGal, where I would have the
            opportunity to introduce young girls to coding, similarly to how I learned to code. 
            I love to teach people things, and I would be honored to spark future programmers' 
            interest and confidence just like my mentors did for me.
