        <h2>Component One - Resume</h2>
        <p>The first component of the course was to create an updated, professional resume.
            Below, you will find the resume I created for myself.
        </p>

        <h2>Component Two - Presentation</h2>
        <p>The second course component was to create an effective slideshow. Although
            this component was <i>not</i> presented verbally, the objective was to create
            a slideshow that would be engaging and informative without overloading the viewer
            with words on screen.
        </p>
        <p>For my slideshow, I chose to discuss Computer Forensics. I had slides touching on
            topics such as a definition of Computer Forensics, its use cases, and some tools and techniques
            associated with the subject. I also included some relevant crimes and cases where 
            Computer Forensics helped to solve the crime and lead to a conviction.

         <h2>Component Three - Elevator Pitch</h2>
         <p>The third component was what is known as an 'elevator pitch'.
            The idea is that you are riding in an elevator with the CEO or hiring
            manager of a company, and you only have that approximately 30 second
            elevator ride to convince that person to hire you.

        <h2>Components Four and Five - Mock Interview and Guest Speakers</h2>
        <p>These components required no submission, save for some exit cards 
            for our wonderful guest speakers. We had four guest speaker activities, including
            some exciting guests who are involved with our local tech landscape. The mock interviews
            were conducted on site at the college, and were a great way to simulate a real interview
            in a low-stakes environment. Post-interview, we were given some excellent feedback in order
            to improve our real-life interview perfomance.

        <h2>Component 6 - Presentation</h2>
        <p>Our final component, other than this portfolio page, was a verbal Presentation
            in front of our classmates. I chose to discuss some basic data types and structures
            used in programming. This was a good opportunity to practice some presentation skills,
            as well as discuss a topic that may have been unfamiliar to many of my classmates.
