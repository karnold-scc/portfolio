        <h2>My Projects to Date</h2>
        <p>This page is just a small snippet of what projets I have done,
            whittled down to those I am most proud of, while also hopefully
            showcasing as many of my skills as possible.

        <h3>Project One - CTRL Freak</h3>
        <p>This project was a group project, completed with three other classmates this semester.
            Designed as a PC Part Store's Inventory Management System, CTRL Freak is a finished
            project. The software allows the user to connect to a MariaDB database, and view a list
            of not only all the software products, but also a table of all their transactions.
            Products and transactions can easily be created, retrieved, updated, and even deleted.
            The software is also capable of generating reciepts for transactions, as well as displaying
            charts that represent the number of products the store offers per brand, as well as some
            statistics regarding product sales.
        </p>

        <h3>Project Two - Angular Framework</h3>
        <p>This project has been an ongoing process over the last four months. Built incrementally in my course on Angular Frameworks,
            I have built a simple single page application that manages a catalog of books. The website supports CRUD operations on the books.
            Throughout this project, I have become familar with the following Angular concepts: Directives, HTTP Requests, Material Design,
            Pipes, Progressive Web Applications, and Services. 
        </p>

        <h3>Project Three - ECommerce Platform</h3>
        <p>This is another project that I created incrementally throughout the semester. This project did involve some files such as
            the CSS being provided for us, as it was irrelevant to the course, which was focused on intermediate-level PHP techniques.
            The site is effectively a fully-functioning ecommerce auction platform. It connects to a backend database to manage items, bids,
            users, and payment reciepts. The site connects to the PayPal Sandbox API, but could easily be adapted to use the live API, and
            serve as a real ecommerce platform. Winning bidders and item owners are both emailed when the auction ends.
